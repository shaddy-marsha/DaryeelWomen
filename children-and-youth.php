              <p class="para">Children growing up surrounded by poverty, conflicts or in the aftermath of disaster have high risks and their choices are limited. As young people mature, 
                the decisions they make have an enormous impact on their families, their communities and our world. When disaster strikes, young children are especially vulnerable to 
                developing emotional and social problems that can jeopardize their futures That's why giving children and youth the right support at this most critical time is essential 
                to building tomorrow’s strong and productive communities. <br><br>
                At Wajir Initiative Network, we undertake mentorship programs for boys and girls in schools. During the mentorship programs young boys and girls are trained to be responsible 
                citizens. We create forums where the children and the youth can meet and socialize through play, art and sports. This has been very helpful especially in the recent past when 
                youth radicalization has been on the increase.<br><br>  
                For adolescents faced with violence, early marriage and interruptions to schooling, we provide opportunities for community involvement, vocational training and life skills 
                development. Our goal is to empower youth in the toughest places to make smart life choices and invest their energy in developing solutions to their countries’ biggest challenges.
